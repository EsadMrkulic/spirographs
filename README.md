# Spirographs
Program that draws four random spirographs simultaneously. 

This is a program that brings up the turtle GUI, and draws four spirographs at the same time.
The spirographs are completely random, meaning everytime you run the program, you get something different each time. 
You can show the turtles by clicking "T" and reset the spirographs by clicking the "space" key.
This is completely math based. 
Furthermore, I learned how to do this from a Python book called, "Python Playground".

To break down how this project works, there are 2 classes; one for the spiro itself which is the math based portion, and the other for actually animating the spiros. In each class are functions for random and fixed parameters, updating, and resetting.
